    <h2>What is Pain Day?</h2>
    <p>
        Join us on October 16th, 2025, at the Medical College of Wisconsin for a dynamic one-day conference dedicated to advancing pain research, presented by the Wisconsin Institute of NeuroScience (WINS). 
        This event brings together experts from basic science, translational research, and clinical studies to explore the latest breakthroughs in understanding and treating pain. 
        Featuring two distinguished plenary speakers, as well as opportunities for trainees to present their research, this conference fosters collaboration, innovation, and meaningful discussions among scientists, clinicians, and emerging scholars. 
        Whether you're an established investigator or an early-career researcher, this is a unique opportunity to connect with peers and contribute to the future of pain science.
